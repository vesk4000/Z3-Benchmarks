Z3's programmatic [API](https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/) exposes all available optimization features.
- [Follow this link for a tutorial on using optimization features from F#.](http://lonelypad.blogspot.dk/2014/08/f-and-linear-programming-introduction.html)
- The Python API is also convenient for prototyping. The Optimize Python object is used when solving constraints with optimization objectives.
