I'll put my instructions in here, because it seems that I need to restart VS Code a lot here and I lose my conversation with the previous LLM unfortunately. Ignore comments in this file, I just put them there in case I need them later. Just remember, you're an agent in VS Code (unless I run in you in chat mode, which I may do sometimes), so you can do stuff like even running commands (well it asks me to accept the command, but I don't mind that). That being said VS Code is a bit clunky still when it comes to LLMs, for example I'm not fully sure that fetching webpages actually works so I also copy-pasted the guides locally if you need that.

Ok, so I want to benchmark Z3 using Ubuntu and Benchexec on Docker. How can I do that? Ideally, I want to be able to open the docker container in vs code, so I'm more easily able to tinker with it and to configure it. Just a reminder I wanted to benchmark the multiple versions/configurations of Z3 with the multiple smt datasets.

You should have a look at the guide for running benchexec in containers: https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/raw/refs/heads/main/doc/benchexec-in-container.md

It's just that benchexec might have problems with containers, so you really should take that guide into account to make sure that my setup works (do let me know if you actually can read the guide or I should copy paste it).

Also have a look at their quickstart guide: https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/raw/refs/heads/main/doc/quickstart.md

<!-- There they do give a PPA that we can use in Ubuntu, so I'm not quite sure why you're using pip (of course you might have a good reason, I don't know).

I already have something set up. In fact the docker image was successfully built, and it's id is: sha256:26aa64d2ffdd7bb798f480ed2a9dd091dd719dab5044ddddd0645f12f96d2435 -->

To be completely honest I'm not exactly sure what the set up of my project should be. Like I mentioned before I'm on Windows 11 using Docker with WSL2. I want to use Docker (rather than just WSL2) because I want to make my experiments very easily reproducible, so anyone can just open the docker image I provided them and (in as few clicks as possible) just rerun my experiments. I do want to be able to open the Docker in VS Code, so that I can tinker with the setup manually, and like I mentioned I wanted to have maybe some different versions of Z3 (or Z3 with plugins) in the image that I can all compare, so doing all of that in just the Dockerfile seems impractical. I do howeever want to have my code/setup somehow in a repository, so that I can version it somehow. Of course I'll be sharing that code as well, but I don't want the docker image to contain any of my personal details or github logins or anything like that.

Another agent was already able to set up the project and now finally it works, but I'm not fully sure how to verify that it works. They also didn't really answer my concerns in the last pargraph.

There seem to really be two glaring issues rn:
1. I don't actually have a repository (I'm not even fully sure where this folder that I've opened in VS code is on my computer), that's what VS Code says.
2. I may need to run some commands while in the devcontainer, maybe to set some stuff up, stuff like that. How can that be persistent? The thing is, to me at least it seems a bit of a pain in the ass to have all of my setup in the docker file and to have to rebuild the dockerfile every time I want to make a change to the set up (which I'll be doing a lot), I don't know if that's weird.
