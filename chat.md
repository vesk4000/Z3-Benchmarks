Complete Setup Created
I've created several additional files to make your benchmarking setup production-ready:

Tool Definitions (z3-latest.py, z3-4.12.0.py, z3-4.11.2.py): These tell BenchExec how to find and run each Z3 version, and how to parse their output results.

Updated Benchmark Configuration: Enhanced your sample-benchmark.xml to properly reference the custom tool definitions and include more SMT logic categories.

Comprehensive Documentation: Created a detailed README with setup instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.

Next Steps
Now you should be able to:

Restart VS Code and try opening the dev container again. The security option error should be resolved.

Test the setup once inside the container:
z3-latest --version
z3-4.12.0 --version  
z3-4.11.2 --version
benchexec --help

Add your SMT datasets to the datasets/ directory organized by logic (QF_LIA, QF_LRA, etc.)

Run benchmarks using either:

runexec for single file testing
benchexec sample-benchmark.xml for full comparison
About Your Requirements
Your setup addresses all your key requirements:

✅ Docker-based: Fully reproducible environment
✅ VS Code integration: Dev container for easy development
✅ Multiple Z3 versions: Latest, 4.12.0, and 4.11.2 ready to compare
✅ BenchExec compliance: Follows their container guidelines with proper cgroup setup
✅ Version control ready: All configuration files are in your repository
✅ Privacy-safe: No personal details embedded in the container
Try reopening the dev container now - it should work without the security option errors!
