# Development Workflow for BenchExec and Z3 in Docker

This document describes how to develop, tweak, and share a fully-configured Docker image for benchmarking Z3 with BenchExec, using the **docker commit** snapshot workflow.  No full Docker rebuilds required for each tweak.

---

## 1. Build & Publish the Base Image

1. In your workspace directory (contains Dockerfile):
   ```bash
   docker build -t you/z3-bench:base .
   ```
2. (Optional) Push to Docker Hub or your registry:
   ```bash
   docker push you/z3-bench:base
   ```

This image includes Ubuntu 24.04, BenchExec, multiple Z3 versions, Python deps, and all required tools.

## 2. Day-to-Day Development with `docker commit`

Whenever you need to install a new OS package, tweak configs, or add Python libs:

1. Start an interactive container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --privileged \
     -v $(pwd):/workspace \
     --name z3-dev you/z3-bench:base bash
   ```
2. Inside the container, make your changes:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y <package>
   pip3 install <python-package>
   # edit configs, scripts, etc.
   ```
3. Exit the shell.
4. Snapshot your changes into a new image:
   ```bash
   docker commit z3-dev you/z3-bench:dev
   ```
5. (Optional) Push the `:dev` tag:
   ```bash
   docker push you/z3-bench:dev
   ```

Now `you/z3-bench:dev` contains all your interactive tweaks without rebuilding from scratch.

## 3. Integrate with VS Code

1. In `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, reference your dev image:
   ```json
   {
     "image": "you/z3-bench:dev",
     "workspaceFolder": "/workspace",
     "runArgs": ["--privileged"],
     // ... other settings ...
   }
   ```
2. Reopen in Container: VS Code will pull and start your `:dev` image instantly.
3. Work, test, benchmark in `/workspace` with all your tools preinstalled.

## 4. Cleaning Up & Versioning

- Remove old containers and images you no longer need:
  ```bash
  docker rm z3-dev
  docker image prune -f
  ```
- Keep your container setup and benchmark scripts under Git in `/workspace` to version control your experiments.

## 5. Verifying Your Dev Container

1. In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select **Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container**.
2. Once the container starts, open an integrated terminal (View â†’ Terminal).
3. Run the following to confirm tools are available and working:
   ```bash
   z3 --version
   benchexec --help
   benchexec sample-benchmark.xml
   ```
4. After `benchexec sample-benchmark.xml` completes, check that a results directory was created in `/workspace/results` with the run summary.
5. If all commands succeed, your container environment is correctly configured and ready for custom benchmarks.

With this pattern, you get an instantly startable, shareable image on Docker Hub, plus unlimited interactive tweaking without painful rebuilds.
